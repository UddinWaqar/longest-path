The longest path problem for a general graph is not as easy as the shortest path problem because the longest path problem doesn’t have optimal substructure property. In fact, the Longest Path problem is NP-Hard for a general graph. However, the longest path problem has a linear time solution for directed acyclic graphs.this code will be run in visual stdio c++.
